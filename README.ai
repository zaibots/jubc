# 🔱 Zaibots Protocol (JUBC): Core Substrate

This repository manages the **Core Protocol DNA** for the Zaibots ecosystem. It is a high-fidelity fork of **Aave v3.6**, clinicalized for the EthGlobal 2026 strike.

**Core Mandate:** Establish a nearly trustless lending and borrowing environment where **AIEN** (Compute Commodity) serves as the primary debt asset.

## 🧬 Architectural Identity
- **Protocol**: Zaibots JUBC (Lending/Borrowing Substrate).
- **Primary Asset**: **AIEN** (Rebranded from GHO/jUBC).
- **Oracle Anchor**: Integrated with the **8004 TEE Oracle** for nearly trustless inference.

## 🛠️ Technical Strikes
- **Rebrand Strategy**: Aave → Zaibots; GHO/jUBC → AIEN.
- **Compute Commodity**: AIEN is managed as a commodity representing compute power, backed by USDC and other collateral.
- **Foundry-Hardened**: All contracts are verified via Foundry and clinicalized for TEE-enclave compatibility.

## ⚖️ Sovereign Mandate for Agents
1.  **Map the Topography**: Use `forge inspect` to verify contract coordinates before execution.
2.  **Clinical Precision**: Modification of protocol parameters (LTV, Interest Rates) requires **Multi-Sig Ratification** via the 8004 Oracle Pipe.
3.  **No Drift**: Ensure parity between the local Foundry substrate and the deployed Zaibots instance.
